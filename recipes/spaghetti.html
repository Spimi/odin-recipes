        <li>1/4 c. plus 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 c. whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 c. Italian bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1/4 c. finely minced Italian parsley</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced (divided)</li>
        <li>1 lb. hot Italian sausage, cut into 1" pieces</li>
        <li>2 28-oz. cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>

        <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>1 lb. Cooked spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together ground beef, milk, bread crumbs, egg, salt, pepper, Parmesan, parsley, and half the garlic in a large bowl. Using your hands, form the mixture into large meatballs.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, fry meatballs until browned on all sides and almost cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat another 2 tablespoons oil and cook sausage, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Add cooked sausage to plate with meatballs.</li>
        <li>Wipe skillet clean, then add remaining olive oil. Cook remaining garlic over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and tomato paste and stir to combine. Stir in sausage and meatballs, then add wine and sugar. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over a large bowl of spaghetti. Garnish with Parmesan.</li>
