    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make this classic Italian dish really spicy, or deseed the chillies to make it less confronting. Whatever you decide, it's a winning winter warmer!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 brown onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>2 small red chillies, chopped (see note)</li>
        <li>800g can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Massel vegetable liquid stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup small basil leaves</li>
        <li>400g penne rigate</li>
        <li>2 tsp caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and chillies. Cook, stirring often, for 6 to 7 minutes or until onion is soft. Add tomatoes, stock and 1/4 cup basil leaves. Bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large saucepan of boiling, salted water following packet directions, until tender. Drain pasta and return to pan.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar into tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over pasta. Toss to combine. Cover and set aside for 5 minutes (this allows pasta to absorb sauce).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining basil. Spoon into serving bowls and serve.</li>
    </ol>
